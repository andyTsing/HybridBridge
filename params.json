Using HybridBridge you can proxy your C# code on the JavaScript side and as result of this, you have full access to the C# class properties, methods, fields, and events.\r\n\r\nStarting point of this library is the `HybridBridge.BridgeController` class which is a simple list of `HybridBridge.IBridgeHandler` implemented classes. Each `HybridBridge.IBridgeHandler` registered to this class will have the chance to response to the JavaScript side and this makes it easy to expand this library by simply writing new classes implementing `HybridBridge.IBridgeHandler` interface.\r\n\r\nWe also defined and shipped three class implementing `HybridBridge.IBridgeHandler` interface in this library, one for proxying C# classes (`HybridBridge.ClassBridge`), one for proxying C# `enum`s (`HybridBridge.EnumBridge`) and another one just for two-way communication (`HybridBridge.HybridMessagingHandler`). In most cases, these are enough for your project and there is no need to write a new one.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, `HybridBridge.BridgeController` needs to be connected to the native Web Browser controls on each platform. This is done by inheriting this class in platform projects and packages. So you can share your JavaScript, C# code and Html files across all platforms and leave it to the platform packages to make the connection between native Web Browser control and the `HybridBridge.BridgeController` class.\r\n\r\nThis makes it possible to have a two-way communication between C# side and the browser (JavaScript) without any change to the logic of your program.\r\n\r\nFollowing flowchart, tries to show the relationships between classes and the way communication and content delivery works in a cross-platform application using `HybridBridge`:\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/falahati/HybridBridge/blob/master/Flowchart.jpg?raw=true \"Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n### HOW TO USE\r\nAfter adding the correct package to your project, it is possible to map the native Web Browser control to the HybridBridge class using the platform specific children of the `HybridBridge.BridgeController` class. Following examples demonstrate how to create a new instance of this classes and pass the native Web Browser control to be bridged.\r\n\r\n#### Android\r\n`HybridBridge.Android` package contains a class named `WebViewHybridBridge` inheriting from `HybridBridge.BridgeController`. Using this class, you are able to connect the `WebKit.WebView` control to the `HybridBridge` library.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar hybridBridge = new HybridBridge.Android.WebViewHybridBridge(webView);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### iOS\r\n`HybridBridge.iOS` package contains a class named `UIWebViewHybridBridge` inheriting from `HybridBridge.BridgeController`. Using this class, you are able to connect the `Foundation.UIWebView` control to the `HybridBridge` library.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar hybridBridge = new HybridBridge.iOS.UIWebViewHybridBridge(webView);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Universal Windows 10 Store Application (Windows 10 and Windows Phone 10)\r\n`HybridBridge.UWP` package contains a class named `WebViewHybridBridge` inheriting from `HybridBridge.BridgeController`. Using this class you are able to connect the `UI.Core.WebView` control to the `HybridBridge` library.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar hybridBridge = new HybridBridge.UWP.WebViewHybridBridge(webView);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, because of limitations forced on us by the `WebView` control, `WebViewHybridBridge` cannot offer the full functionalities of this library. For more information about this please read the [Windows Store and Windows Phone WebView limitations](#windows-store-and-windows-phone-webview-limitations) part.\r\nAs a workaround, however, `HybridBridge.UWP` offers another way of connecting the `HybridBridge` library to the `WebView`, enabling it to work in full capacity; `WebViewHybridServer` class is responsible for enabling full two-way communication in this situations by opening a local port and handling HTTP request directly.\r\nHowever, for being able to use this class, you should add the `Internet Server` or `Private Server` capacity to your application's manifest file.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar hybridBridge = new HybridBridge.UWP.WebViewHybridServer(webView);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Universal Windows 8.1 Store Application and Windows Phone 8.1 Applications\r\n`HybridBridge.Win81` package contains a class named `WebViewHybridBridge` inheriting from `HybridBridge.BridgeController`. Using this class you are able to connect the `UI.Core.WebView` control to the `HybridBridge` library.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar hybridBridge = new HybridBridge.Win81.WebViewHybridBridge(webView);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, because of limitations forced on us by the `WebView` control, `WebViewHybridBridge` cannot offer the full functionalities of this library. For more information about this please read the [Windows Store and Windows Phone WebView limitations](#windows-store-and-windows-phone-webview-limitations) part.\r\nAs a workaround, however, `HybridBridge.Win81` offers another way of connecting the `HybridBridge` library to the `WebView`, enabling it to works in full capacity; `WebViewHybridServer` class is responsible for enabling full two-way communication in this situations by opening a local port and handling HTTP request directly.\r\nHowever, for being able to use this class, you should add the `Internet Server` or `Private Server` capacity to your application's manifest file.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar hybridBridge = new HybridBridge.Win81.WebViewHybridServer(webView);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Windows Classic Applications (Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation, WPF)\r\n`HybridBridge.Win` package contains two class inheriting from `HybridBridge.BridgeController` making this possible to connect the `Windows.Forms.WebBrowser` and `Windows.Controls.WebBrowser` controls to the `HybridBridge` library.\r\nHowever, this is important to clarify that none of these controls are natively compatible with `HybridBridge` mechanism for handling the request and as result of this, both classes defined in this package are working by opening a local port and listening for incoming HTTP request. This may opens a **Security Hole** to your application while running under Windows.\r\nAlso, you should take care of permissions required for opening a local port on the running system.\r\n\r\n##### Windows Forms (WinForm)\r\n`WebBrowserHybridServer` class is responsible for making the connection to the `Windows.Forms.WebBrowser` control: \r\n```C#\r\nvar hybridBridge = new HybridBridge.Win.WebBrowserHybridServer(webBrowser);\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)\r\n`WPF.WebBrowserHybridServer` class is responsible for making the connection to the `Windows.Forms.WebBrowser` control: \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar hybridBridge = new HybridBridge.Win.WPF.WebBrowserHybridServer(webBrowser);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BRIDGE CONTROLLER (`HybridBridge.BridgeController`)\r\n`HybridBridge.BridgeController` is an abstract class handling and controlling the flow of information in the two-way communication channel between C# and JavaScript.\r\n`HybridBridge.BridgeController` and all its child platform classes do support the following methods:\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.Add()`: Adds a new `IBridgeHandler` instance to the list of request handlers. This is important to note that in the `HybridBridge.BridgeController` abstract class and all its children, unless overridden, it is only possible to have one instance of a type.\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.Clear()`: Clears the list of `IBridgeHandler`s\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.Contains()`: Returns true if the passed instance of `IBridgeHandler` is in the list\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.Remove()`: Removes the passed instance of the `IBridgeHandler` from the list\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.Get<T>` and `HybridBridge.BridgeController.Get()`: Returns the requested `IBridgeHandler` by type\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.ExecuteJavaScript()`: Execute a JavaScript string and return the result. This method also accepts a callback for asynchronies execution.\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.FireJavaScript()`: Executes a JavaScript string and leaves the result. This method is asynchronies by design.\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.CallJavaScriptFunction()`: Calls a JavaScript function and returns the result. This method is synchronizing by design.\r\n* `HybridBridge.BridgeController.CallJavaScriptAction()`: Calls a JavaScript function and leaves the result. This method is asynchronies by design.\r\n\r\n### CLASS BRIDGE (`HybridBridge.ClassBridge<T>`)\r\n`HybridBridge.ClassBridge<T>` is a generic class implementing the `IBridgeHandler` interface allowing the user to be able to proxy a C# class on the JavaScript side.\r\nThis class is capable of proxying methods, fields, constants, properties, and events; providing the JavaScript side with the ability to call, get, set and subscribe to and from methods, events and properties asynchronicity and synchronicity.\r\n\r\nConsider the following controller class for next samples:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nnamespace MyProject.Controllers\r\n{\r\n    public class MyController\r\n    {\r\n        public static const int MyIntConst = 10;\r\n        public static event Action<int> MyStaticEvent;\r\n        public static int MyStaticIntProperty { get; set; };\r\n        public static MyModel MyStaticComplexFields;\r\n        public static string MyStaticMethod(string someStringValue)\r\n        {\r\n            // Do something with someStringValue variable\r\n        }\r\n        public void MySampleMethod()\r\n        {\r\n            // Do something\r\n        }\r\n        public MyController(int ctorArgument)\r\n        {\r\n            // Do something with ctorArgument and create a new instance\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n#### Methods\r\nCalling class methods is possible in both asynchronous and synchronize ways. The result of the method execution is also available; however, no `out` or `ref` parameters are supported. Also special methods such as the ones with `await` keyword are not officially supported.\r\n\r\n**C#** code to add the proxy class to the JavaScript side:\r\n```C#\r\n    var myControllerBridge = \r\n        new HybridBridge.ClassBridge<MyProject.Controllers.MyController>();\r\n    hybridBridge.Add(myControllerBridge);\r\n```\r\n**JavaScript** code to call the method and get the return value:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    var methodReturnValue = \r\n        MyProject.Controllers.MyController.MyStaticMethod(someStringValue);\r\n```\r\nor asynchronously:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.MyStaticMethodAsync(someStringValue, function (methodReturnValue) {\r\n        // propertyValue has the value of the property\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n#### Properties\r\nIt is possible to access and change property values; this library also supports properties with custom setter and getter methods.\r\n\r\n**C#** code to add the proxy class to the JavaScript side:\r\n```C#\r\n    var myControllerBridge = \r\n        new HybridBridge.ClassBridge<MyProject.Controllers.MyController>();\r\n    hybridBridge.Add(myControllerBridge);\r\n```\r\n**JavaScript** code to access the property value:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    var propertyValue = \r\n        MyProject.Controllers.MyController.MyStaticIntProperty;\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```Javascript\r\n    var propertyValue = \r\n        MyProject.Controllers.MyController.get_MyStaticIntProperty();\r\n```\r\nor asynchronously:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.get_MyStaticIntPropertyAsync(function (propertyValue) {\r\n        // propertyValue has the value of the property\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n**JavaScript** code to set the property value:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.MyStaticIntProperty = newValue;\r\n```\r\nor\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.set_MyStaticIntProperty(newValue);\r\n```\r\nor asynchronously:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.set_MyStaticIntPropertyAsync(newValue, function () {\r\n        // Indicates that the setter called successfully\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Fields\r\nAccessing fields and constants are as easy as accessing properties; however, there is no way to directly call setter or getter methods or to interact with fields asynchronously. Constants, on the other hand, are directly reflected on the JavaScript side as a variable.\r\n\r\n**C#** code to add the proxy class to the JavaScript side:\r\n```C#\r\n    var myControllerBridge = \r\n        new HybridBridge.ClassBridge<MyProject.Controllers.MyController>();\r\n    hybridBridge.Add(myControllerBridge);\r\n```\r\n**JavaScript** code to access a field or a constant value:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    var constValue = MyProject.Controllers.MyController.MyIntConst;\r\n```\r\n**JavaScript** code to change a field value:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.MyIntConst = newValue;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Events\r\nSubscribing and unsubscribing to and from an event is little different from the way it is in C#. For doing so you need to use the `add_{event}` and `remove_{event}` methods or access the event like a field.\r\n\r\n**C#** code to add the proxy class to the JavaScript side:\r\n```C#\r\n    var myControllerBridge = \r\n        new HybridBridge.ClassBridge<MyProject.Controllers.MyController>();\r\n    hybridBridge.Add(myControllerBridge);\r\n```\r\n**JavaScript** code to subscribe to an event:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    function MyEventHandler(intValue) {\r\n        // Do something with the intValue\r\n    }\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.add_MyStaticEvent(MyEventHandler);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.add_MyStaticEvent(function (intValue) {\r\n        // Do something with the intValue\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nIt is also possible to replace all old subscriptions with a new one:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    function MyEventHandler(intValue) {\r\n        // Do something with the intValue\r\n    }\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.MyStaticEvent = MyEventHandler;\r\n```\r\n**JavaScript** code to unsubscribe an event:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.remove_MyStaticEvent(MyEventHandler);\r\n```\r\nOr remove all subscriptions altogether:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    MyProject.Controllers.MyController.MyStaticEvent = null;\r\n```\r\n#### Instances\r\nJust like static methods, it is possible to reflect functionalities of the instances of a class on the JavaScript side. However, for doing so you need to choose the variable name on the C# side and pass it to the `ClassBridge<T>.AddInstance()` method.\r\nIt is also possible to not mention a variable name; this makes the instance available on the JavaScript side, however with no clear way to access it. This behavior is rarely useful.\r\n\r\n**C#** code to add the proxy class and its instance to the JavaScript side:\r\n```C#\r\n    var myControllerBridge = \r\n        new HybridBridge.ClassBridge<MyProject.Controllers.MyController>();\r\n    var controllerInstance = new MyProject.Controllers.MyController(someIntValue);\r\n    myControllerBridge.AddInstance(controllerInstance, \"JavaScriptInstanceVariable\");\r\n    hybridBridge.Add(myControllerBridge);\r\n```\r\nOn the **JavaScript** side, it is possible to access this instance using the variable name; following sample shows how to call a method on the reflexed instance:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    JavaScriptInstanceVariable.MySampleMethod();\r\n```\r\nHowever, it is important to know that by doing so, `ClassBridge<T>` keeps a reference to the instance in the memory and this may result in a memory leak if abused. So it is always a good practice to remove the instance as soon as it is no longer needed.\r\nCheck out the following sample to remove one or multiple instances from the JavaScript side using the instance’s variable name:\r\n```C#\r\n    myControllerBridge.RemoveInstance(\"JavaScriptInstanceVariable\");\r\n```\r\nOr using the instance(s) directly. This, however, will clear all variables to this instance on the JavaScript side:\r\n```C#\r\n    myControllerBridge.RemoveInstance(controllerInstance);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Instantiating\r\nIt is possible to create a new instance of a class directly from the JavaScript side. This will call the class constructor and then adds the newly created instance automatically. It is important to use this feature with caution to prevent memory leak:\r\n\r\n**C#** code to add the proxy class to the JavaScript side:\r\n```C#\r\n    var myControllerBridge = \r\n        new HybridBridge.ClassBridge<MyProject.Controllers.MyController>();\r\n    hybridBridge.Add(myControllerBridge);\r\n```\r\nAnd to create the new instance on **JavaScript**:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    var JavaScriptInstanceVariable = \r\n        new MyProject.Controllers.MyController(someIntValue);\r\n```\r\n### `HybridBridge.HybridMessagingHandler`\r\nUsing `HybridBridge.HybridMessagingHandler` your application can have a fast and two-way communication channel. Unlike `HybridBridge.ClasBridge<T>`, using this handler, you don't need to define a controller class and this makes thing a lot easier and faster.\r\n\r\nMaking a new instance of the `HybridBridge.HybridMessagingHandler` accessible on the JavaScript side:\r\n```C#\r\n    var hybridMessaging = new HybridBridge.HybridMessagingHandler();\r\n    hybridBridge.Add(massagingHandler);\r\n```\r\n\r\nListen to messages with 'MyMessage' identification on **C#**:\r\n```C#\r\n    hybridMessaging.Subscribe(\"MyMessage\", () => {\r\n        // Do something\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nOr on **JavaScript**:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    HybridMessaging.Subscribe(\"MyMessage\", function() {\r\n        // Do something\r\n    });\r\n```\r\nIt is also possible to return a value as the result of the message execution as well as sending an optional parameter. Following examples shows how to send a message with ` MyMessageWithParameter` as its identification on **C#**:\r\n```C#\r\n    hybridMessaging.Send(\"MyMessageWithParameter\", someParameter);\r\n```\r\nOr if expecting a string as the result and sending an `int` as the parameter:\r\n```C#\r\n    var result = hybridMessaging.Send<String, Int>(\"MyMessageWithPrameter\", someIntParameter);\r\n```\r\nOr on **JavaScript**:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    var returnValue = HybridMessaging.Send(\"MyMessage\", someParameter);\r\n```\r\nDoing same thing on **JavaScript** asynchronously looks like this:\r\n```Javascript\r\n    HybridMessaging.SendAsync(\"MyMessage\", someParameter, function (returnValue) {\r\n        // Do something with returnValue\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n`HybridMessaging` variable on the JavaScript is the representation of the `HybridBridge.HybridMessagingHandler` instance on the C# side. However, its name can be changed by explicitly passing a different name as a string to the `HybridBridge.HybridMessagingHandler` constructor.\r\n\r\n### LIMITATIONS\r\n* `out` keyword for method parameters\r\n* `ref` keyword for method parameters\r\n\r\n#### Windows Store and Windows Phone WebView limitations\r\nDue to `UI.Core.WebView` running the JavaScript engine on the UI thread along with itself processing requests on the same thread, it is impossible to execute JavaScript methods that blocks the execution of the script as it does also block the control from receiving the request.\r\nThis means that any synchronized method or call on the proxy class is not supported; following is the list of limitations:\r\n* Synchronized calls on method puts UI thread on deadlock and therefore not possible\r\n* Getting or Setting property values synchronicity is not possible\r\n* Getting or setting field values is not possible at all\r\n* Sending synchronized messages is not possible\r\n\r\nAs the result of the above limitation, we suggest using classes that inherit the `HybridBridge.LocalServer.LocalBridgeServer` class letting controller opens a local port and response to the HTTP requests made from JavaScript. This makes the necessary separation from UI thread and therefore allows your code to use full functionalities of the `HybridBridge` library.\r\nFollowing is the list of classes that are part of the `HybridBridge.LocalServer.LocalBridgeServer` inheritance tree:\r\n* `HybridBridge.UWP.WebViewHybridServer`: Universal Windows 10 Applications for PC and Mobile Phones\r\n* `HybridBridge.Win81.WebViewHybridServer`: Universal Windows 8.1 Applications for PC and Mobile Phones\r\n* `HybridBridge.Win.WebBrowserHybridServer`: Classic Windows Applications such as Windows Form and WPF\r\n\r\nHowever, using above classes may make your program vulnerable to attacks targeting the local HTTP server. On the other hand, to be able to use this method, you might need to allow your program certain capacities and permissions under each platform you are targeting.\r\n\r\n### DOCUMENTATION\r\nThe project online documentation is available at [github.io](http://falahati.github.io/HybridBridge/doxygen).\r\n\r\n### LICENSE\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\r\n\r\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\r\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\r\nthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\r\nLicense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\r\n\r\n  0.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\r\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\r\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\r\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\r\n       Version.\r\n\r\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\r\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\r\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\r\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\r\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\r\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\r\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\r\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\r\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\r\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\r\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\r\n\r\n  5. Combined Libraries.\r\n\r\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\r\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\r\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\r\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\r\n\r\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\r\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\r\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\r\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\r\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\r\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\r\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\r\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\r\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\r\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\r\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\r\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\r\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\r\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\r\nLibrary.\r\n</pre>\r\n",
