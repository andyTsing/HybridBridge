      Soroush Falahati's HybridBridge Library
------------------------------------------------------
This is a PCL library that lets you connect Javascript on the browser side to the C# code  by 
proxying C# side. For this library to be usable you need to add one of the following packages
next to it:

* HybridBridge.Android
* HybridBridge.iOS
* HybridBridge.UWP
* HybridBridge.Win
* HybridBridge.Win81

Or you can expand the `HybridBridge.BridgeController` class for your environment.
